>  Backend Software Engineer

Software craftsmanship, agile mindset and best practices are the keywords that best describe me as an engineer.
I focus in code quality: cleanness, testability and simplicity are my tools for achieving this goal.
I have most working experience with Java, Clojure and Python. I prefer strongly typed functional programming languages 
but I consider myself language-agnostic. I understand software engineering as handling complexity 
and keeping it under control, so I always focus my learning and self-improvement towards practices 
and processes that allow me to do that in any language.

Activities and interests
------------------------

Aside from functional programming, I enjoy learning new languages. Estoy aprendiendo espa√±ol por diversion.
When not in front of my computer, I can be found [cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/4646191)
or trying to produce music on my bass (although I'm pretty bad at it). Civic activist [since 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euromaidan).
